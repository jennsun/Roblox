To create a clothing GUI implemented in a Roblox game. This provides an easier way to change appearance (over admin comands like Kohl's)
and also expedites the video production process.

The following scripts belong under StarterGui -> Catalog:
- CatalogLocal
- InventoryLocal
- LocalScript
- NavLocal
- cloneTrooper

all are LocalScripts except for cloneTrooper, which is a ModuleScript

Not included are Menus and Nav, which are under catalog as well. 

To implement the text button, under ScreenGui -> TextButton, use the LocalScript (named as ButtonLocalScript).
